# BetterEpisodeList
A plugin for [stremio-enhanced](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced-community) that adds the option 'all' in the season list to merge all episodes from a show to one list + adds a serachbar to [stremio-enhanced](https://github.com/REVENGE977/stremio-enhanced-community). Both are very useful to find episodes in shows like One Piece, for example, where episodes are grouped in seasons instead of just being in one season like other platforms. This plugin adds the option to group all episodes in one episode list and count the episodes as they are in one list. [Vote here for stremio to add this feature natively](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-features/issues/524).

The searchbar feature has already been implemented in [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com/), but has not been implemented in the official client, yet.
